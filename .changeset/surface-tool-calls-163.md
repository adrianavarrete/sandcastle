Surface tool calls in run logs (issues #163, #164, #165, #166).

`parseStreamJsonLine` now returns an array of events per line. Assistant messages may produce `text` and/or `tool_call` items. Tool calls are filtered to an allowlist (Bash, WebSearch, WebFetch, Agent) with per-tool arg extraction, and displayed interleaved with agent text output. The Display service gains a `toolCall(name, formattedArgs)` method rendered as a dim-styled step in terminal mode and a plain log line in log-to-file mode.
